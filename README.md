# MNIST Optimizer Comparison

This project compares the performance of two different optimizers, **Adam** and **SGD**, when training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting the accuracy comparison.

You can install these dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
